# LNMIIT Shopping Complex

LNMIIT Shopping Complex is an android application that serves the purpose of stock management for shops such as Stationery and Photostat Shop, Barber Shop, Grocery and Fruit Shop, Laundry Shop, etc. As of now, the Stationery and Photostat Shop has been implemented.

### Motive
The main motive of developing this application was to help the vendors manage their shop and also help them retain customers. Generally, the customers (students) visit the shop to buy a particular item. If the shop is closed or that item is unavailable, the customers have to return empty-handed. This causes the customers to want to go to a different shop; hence, the shopkeeper loses customers. Hence, this application would help the shopkeeper ensure the item's availability and allow the customer to view the shop status.

### There are 3 user modes - Shopkeeper, Employee, Customer.
The shopkeeper or employee can add/delete categories of products, add/delete product items, update the quantity and price of the product item. The shopkeeper can add/remove employees. The customer can view the products, send documents for photostat, and so on.

The app provides convenient and compact solutions to manage stores effectively, saving time and generating business growth. 

### Features:
- Set shop status - Open or Closed
- Add/Delete categories of products
- Add/Delete product items
- Update name, quantity, or price of the items
- Manage Employees
- Add documents for photostat

We plan to add features that allow the employees and shopkeepers to manage orders and generate bills.

Tech Used: Java. Android Studio, Google Cloud Firebase Database
